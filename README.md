# Bayesian-AB-testing
Application of MCMC and Bayesian statistics in AB testing
 Then, the dataset is aggregated for Control and Test groups. The Daily Visitors and Total Enquiries are selected as visit and converted respectively. So, the conversion is enquiry/visit.
 My approach for AB testing is using stochastic modelling and particularly, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation to calculate the posterior probability of A and B conversion.
